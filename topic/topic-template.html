  <h1>Topic Title (starts with a verb)</h1>
  <p>topic introduction. For a task-oriented page, the introduction indicates what the user will accomplish by performing the task. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>What can users do?</li>
    <li>Why do they want to do it?</li>
    <li>How can they do it?</li>
    <li>How can they solve problems doing it?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Depending upon the complexity of the task, a well-designed help page may cover each of the first three questions in one or two sentences and the fourth in two or three bullet points.</p>

  <p id="requirements">Requirements for performing the task. For a task page, any conditions that must be met in order for the task to succeed should be mentioned up front, before the user begins the task. For example, if the help topic is "Burning a CD," the system requirements—such
    as the presence of a CD burner—for burning the CD should be mentioned here.</p>

  <p id="task">The task description.</p>

  <p id="step-1">These are the steps that the user must perform to accomplish the given task. </p>

  <p id="wrap-up">The topic wrap-up. This includes any information the user may need in order to wrap up any task described in the page. It is also a good place to include tips, shortcuts, troubleshooting information</p>
