<p>The first time you save a table, you choose the format, file name, and where to save it. While editing the data, save your changes regularly so your work isn't lost. You can change the format, file name, and location of your saved data. Each table is saved individually.</p>

<h3>Save a table for the first time</h3>
<p>Choose File &gt; Save As, then select the type of file, enter a file name, and choose the file location to store the data. You can save your data as a:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Comma Separated Value file (CSV)</li>
    <li>Semicolon Separated Value file</li>
    <li>Tab Separated Value< file (TSV)</li>
  </ul>
  
<h3>Save changes to the table</h3>
<p>After saving the table for the first time and editing the data, Choose File &gt; Save As, to save the data using format, name, and location originally specified. </p>

<h3>Change the format, name, or location</h3>
