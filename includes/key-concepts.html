<h1>Key concepts</h1>


<p>The focus of Comma Chameleon is on preparing data for publishing, more so than improving the quality of the data. Hence the focus will be more on providing machine and human readable metadata. Data quality checks are done to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ensure the data complies with the metadata </li>
  <li>relevant metadata is provided so reusers can determine if the data is fit for their purpose minimising the need to download and inspect the data.</li>
</ul>
