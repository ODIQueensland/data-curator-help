# Data Curator Help
[Help pages](https://qcif.github.io/data-curator-help/) for [Data Curator](https://github.com/qcif/data-curator).

Most of the content is in `/includes` so it can be reused in individual `/topic` pages or combined into one file, `all-topics.html`, so the help can shown, searched or printed as a single web page.

Nothing fancy here, just static html, css, and js for the includes.
